        domain: The Domain Name System (DNS) was created to change the hostâ€™s domain
          name to a network address or the vice versa.  The DNS changes the easy to
          read domain name of a computer or any device connected to the network to
          a specific number address called an IP address. The DNS is also sometimes
          compared to a phonebook. The internet domain address of a TCP/IP system
          for example, www.example.com, will be changed to an ip address like 192.168.1.0
          by the DNS system, and also is a database system that provides routing information
          for networks.
